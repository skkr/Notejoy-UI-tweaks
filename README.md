# Notejoy-UI-tweaks

This CSS code modifies the design of [NoteJoy](https://notejoy.com/) in order to get a cleaner UI and improve the text hierarchies _(text color is changed only in Scarlet themes)_.

### What's this about

In general, I think the design of the app is really nice, but one thing making all the text in the same color difficulties the readability a little, and the same happens when the lines of text are too long, so I tweaked the NoteJoy's UI to address these issues.  

Also, while this is mainly a personal preference, since I am very used to the Simplenote's UI, I moved out the main menu. This is CSS only so to open the main menu, you'll have place the mouse pointer over the left edge of the window. You can also use the âŒ˜+J shortcut to open the "quick find" floating panel, which will allow you to access most of the things included in the main menu.

### How to use it

To add the custom styles you can use [Amino](https://aminoeditor.com/) or [Stylebot](https://stylebot.dev/). 

Install one of the extensions in your browser, go to [notejoy.com](https://notejoy.com/), and launch the extension, then just copy paste the CSS.
